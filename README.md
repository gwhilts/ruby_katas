```ruby
anagrams = Anagrams.new( %w{ foo echo car baz rat chore bar art tar ochre } )

anagrams.find_for 'rat'
=> ['art', 'rat', 'tar']

anagrams.find_for 'chore'
=> ['chore', 'ochre']
```

### Word Clock

**Exercise**

Convert numerical times into text

Times should be rounded to the nearest five minutes, then described using the following words:

"It's", "about", "quarter", "twenty", "twenty", "five", "ten", "half", "past", "to",
"one", "two", "three", "four", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine",
and "eleven", "twelve".

If the time is on the hour, the phrase should end with "o'clock".

**Examples**

```ruby
Clock.say 4, 25
=> "It is twenty five past four."

Clock.say 6, 50
=> "It is ten to seven."

Clock.say 12, 58
=> "It is about one o'clock."
```

### Fibonacci Digit Count

**Exercise**

One of the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=25), is to determine the index
of the first number in the Fibonacci sequence containing 1000 digits.

The kata here is to write a method that will take a count, C, and quickly return the index of the sequence
that has at least C digits. It should be able to return the answer in less than a second, when searching 
for numbers up to at least 10,000 digits.


**Examples**

```ruby
Fib.first_with_digit_count 2
=> 8
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Fib.first_with_digit_count 3
=> 12
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

Fib.first_with_digit_count 10000
=> 47847
# returns in ~ 0.1s
```

----

### Collatz Sequence

**Exercise**

[Project Euler problem 14](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14) asks us to find the starting number under
1,000,000 that creates the longest Collatz chain.

The sequence begins with a number n, then continues with n/2 if is even, or (3n + 1) if n is odd. The rule
is repeated until n reaches one. (It is assumed that it will always reach 1.)

To solve the Project Euler problem, let's write a class with a method that will return the Collatz sequence
beginning with any given positive number. Then add a method that returns the starting number and length of 
the longest chain that begins with a number less than or equal to a given limit.

**Examples**

```ruby
Collatz.sequence_from 13
=> [13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

Collatz.sequence_from 6
=> [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

Collatz.longest_under 8
=> { start: 7, length: 17 }

Collatz.longest_under 2000
=> { start: 1161, length: 182 }
```

----

### Number Words

**Exercise**

[Project Euler problem 17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17) asks us to 
convert all the numbers from 1 to 1000 to English phrases, then count up all
the letters.

To solve the problem, create a class with two methods: one that will convert
any number (up to at least 9999) to an English phrase, and a second that will
return the letter count for any number or range of numbers (up to 9999).

The phrases should adhere to the British tradition of using the word "and" like so:

- 413  => "four hundred and thirteen"
- 2148 => "two thousand one hundred and forty eight"

The count should ignore spaces and other non-letter characters.

**Examples**

```ruby
NumberWords.say 916
=> "nine hundred and sixteen"

NumberWords.say 2400
=> "two thousand four hundred"

NumberWord.letter_count 16
=> 7

NumberWord.letter_count 1, 20
=> 112
```

### Amicable Numbers

**Exercise**

_From [Project Euler, Problem 21](https://projecteuler.net/problem=21)_

> Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
> If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
> 
> For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. 
> The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
> 
> Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

To solve this problem let's create a class with two public methods: One that will
return the unique pairs of amicable numbers up to a given limit, and another that 
will return the sum of all the amicable numbers up to a limit.

**Examples**

```ruby
AmicableNumbers.pairs_to 300
=> [[220, 284]]

AmicableNumbers.pairs_to 2000
=> [[220, 284], [1184, 1210]] 

AmicableNumbers.sum_to 300
=> 504

AmicableNumbers.sum_to 2000
=> 2898
```

### Gilded Rose

**Exercise**

Refactor the `GildedRose` so that you easily add code to support the new requirement described below:

> **Original Description of the Gilded Rose**
>
> Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city 
> run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods 
> are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates 
> our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. 
> Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an 
> introduction to our system:
> 
> All items have a Days Remaining value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
> All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
> At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
> Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:
> 
> Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
> The Quality of an item is never negative
> "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
> The Quality of an item is never more than 50
> "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
> "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as it's Days Remaining value approaches; Quality increases by 2
> when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
> We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:
> 
> "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items.
> 
> Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however "Sulfuras" is a legendary
> item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.


**Note**

The code here is based on the version Sandi Metz used in her talk,
"All the Little Things". It is slightly different than Jim Weirich's
version (itself a variation of a C# example). Jim used an unbound method,
`update_quality(item)` that took a Struct with three attributes: a `name`,
a `quality` metric, and a `sell_in` value representing the number of
days remaining before the item should be sold. In Sandi's version, the
method and the attributes belong to instances of a `GildedRose` class 
(before refactoring). In both versions the `update_quality` method
(which Sandi call `tick`) is fifty or so lines of tangled, nested if
statements, that beg to be refactored into something more manageable.

I've also implemented the test Jim included with his version, adjusted
to accommodate using the GildedRose class, and ported from somewhat
dated rspec-given code to minitest-spec.  All the tests for the 
existing code is passing. The tests for the new "Conjured Item" code is
set to skip, so we can refactor "in the green" before adding it.

**Examples**

```ruby

item = GildedRose.new("Free Range Platypus Eggs", 10, 6)
=> #<GildedRose:0x007ff34d93b640 @days_remaining=6, @name="Free Range Platypus Eggs", @quality=10>

item.update_quality

item.days_remaining
=> 5

item.quality
=> 9


tix = GildedRose.new("Backstage pass to Elvis Costello show", 39, 1)
=> #<GildedRose:0x007ff34da0ba98 @days_remaining=2, @name="Backstage pass to Elvis Costello show", @quality=40>

tix.update_quality

tix.days_remaining
=> 0

tix.quality
=> 42

tix.update_quality

tix.days_remaining
=> -1

tix.quality
=> 0
```
